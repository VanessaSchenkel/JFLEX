# JFLEX
A simple lexical analyzer for C

## Installation

Install [jflex](https://https://jflex.de/).

## Usage

```bash
jflex lexical.jflex 
```
That will create a java file named LexicalAnalyzer (you can change it in the jflex file)

```bash
javac LexicalAnalyzer.java 
```
That will create a LexicalAnalyzer.class

```bash
java LexicalAnalyzer entrada.txt  
```
With this command you can run the class and the file. It will show in your terminal line by line of the lexical analyzer.
